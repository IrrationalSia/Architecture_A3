# Architecture_A3
Hi! This is my repository for an assignment comprising of 2 parts that are not really related.
We are working with MIPS assembly language

Part One: increase_brightness.asm
This part of the program is meant to read a PPM image file,
modify the pixel values by increasing each RGB value by 10, 
and then write the modified image to a new file. 

Part Two: .asm
