Hi! This is my repository for an assignment comprising of 2 parts that are not really related.
We are working with MIPS assembly language

Part One: increase_brightness.asm
This part of the program is meant to read a PPM image file,
modify the pixel values by increasing each RGB value by 10, 
and then write the modified image to a new file. 

Currently fixing:

Average pixel value of the original image:
481
Average pixel value of new image:
2953
-- program is finished running --

Average pixel value of the original image:124Average pixel value of new image:154
-- program is finished running --

Average pixel value of the original image:
124
Average pixel value of new image:
154
-- program is finished running --

Average pixel value of the original image:
2.327E-321
Average pixel value of new image:
2.885E-321
-- program is finished running --

Part Two: .asm
